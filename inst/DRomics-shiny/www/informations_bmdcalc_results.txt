A table is provided reporting the results of the fit and BMD computation on 
each selected item sorted in the ascending order of the adjusted p-values 
returned by the item selection step. The given results are: 

- id: the item identifier
- irow: the row number in the initial dataset
- adjpvalue: the adjusted p-values returned by the item selection step
- model: the best model fitted
- nbpar: the number of parameters of this best model 
- b, c, d, e, and f, 
  the model parameter values (see Larras et al. for their interpretation)
- SDres: the residual standard deviation of the best model
- typology: the class of typology (twelve class typology as described in the 
  dose response modelling step)
- trend: the rough trend of the curve defined with four classes (U, bell, increasing or decreasing shape)
- y0: theoretical value at the control
- yrange: theoretical y range for x within the range of tested doses
- xextrem: for biphasic curves, x value at which their extremum is reached
- yextrem: the corresponding y value at this extremum
- BMD.zSD: the BMD-zSD value
- BMR.zSD: the corresponding BMR-zSD value
- BMD.xfold: the BMD-xfold value
- BMR.xfold: the corresponding BMR-xfold value
