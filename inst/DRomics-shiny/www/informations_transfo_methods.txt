Both methods RNAseq are transforming raw counts in a log2 scale using the
variance stabilizing transformation ("vst") or regularized logarithm ("rlog").
Both methods aim at removing the dependence of the variance on the mean.
Both methods include a normalization with respect to library size.
"rlog" is recommended but more computer intensive than "vst"
(see Love et al. 2014 for details).
